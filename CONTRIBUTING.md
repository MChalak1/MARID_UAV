# Contributing to MARID

Thank you for your interest in **MARID**.

MARID is an experimental, research-driven project focused on autonomous aerial systems, simulation-first development, and exploratory design. Contributions are welcome, but should be made thoughtfully and with respect for the project’s evolving nature.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Exploration over finality**  
  Many design decisions are provisional and subject to change.

- **Simulation before implementation**  
  Contributions should be reasoned, testable, and ideally supported by simulation or analysis.

- **Clarity over complexity**  
  Readable code, explicit assumptions, and clear explanations are preferred.

- **Respectful collaboration**  
  Critical discussion is encouraged; dismissive or bad-faith engagement is not.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- Asking questions or starting discussions
- Proposing alternative designs or pointing out limitations
- Improving documentation or diagrams
- Fixing bugs or improving simulation fidelity
- Adding validation, logging, or tests
- Suggesting improved modeling assumptions (aero, thermal, control, etc.)

Small, focused contributions are welcome.

---

## Getting Started

1. Read the **README** to understand the project scope and architecture.
2. Browse **Discussions** for ongoing or unresolved topics.
3. Check existing **Issues** before opening a new one.
4. If unsure where something belongs, start with a Discussion.

## Issues vs Discussions

Use the appropriate channel:

### Discussions
- Conceptual questions  
- Design trade-offs  
- Exploratory ideas  
- Requests for clarification  

### Issues
- Bugs  
- Concrete improvements  
- Clearly scoped tasks  

Provide context, reasoning, and references where possible.

---

## Code Contributions

If you plan to submit code:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Keep changes scoped to a single concern.
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Comment assumptions, units, and reference frames explicitly.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless clearly justified.

### Simulation, Dynamics, and Control Code

For guidance, control, or physics-based contributions:

- Clearly state assumptions (frames, sign conventions, simplifications).
- Avoid hard-coded constants without explanation.
- Prefer physically meaningful parameters over tuned "magic numbers".
- If modifying controllers, explain stability or robustness implications.

---

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation is as valuable as code.

You are encouraged to:

- Clarify ambiguous sections
- Add diagrams or explanatory comments
- Improve Markdown files or README sections
- Correct inaccuracies or outdated assumptions

If something is unclear to you, it is likely unclear to others.

---

## Pull Requests

Before opening a pull request:

- Ensure the change builds and runs (if applicable).
- Describe **what changed** and **why**.
- Reference related Issues or Discussions when relevant.
- Be open to review and revision.

Draft pull requests are acceptable for early feedback.

---

## Scope and Expectations

Please note:

- This is **not** a production-ready system.
- This is **not** a finalized or optimized design.
- This **is** an evolving research and learning platform.

Contributions that acknowledge uncertainty and trade-offs are especially appreciated.

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to be respectful, patient, and professional.

Harassment, condescension, or bad-faith behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Final Note

You do not need permission to ask a question or share an idea.  
If you are acting in good faith and thinking carefully, your contribution is welcome.

Thank you for helping improve MARID.
