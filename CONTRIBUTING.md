MARID is an experimental, research-driven project exploring autonomous aerial systems, simulation-first development, and advanced propulsion and control concepts. Contributions are welcome at all levels—questions, critiques, documentation improvements, simulations, and code—but should be made thoughtfully and with respect for the project’s exploratory nature.

Guiding Principles

Curiosity over certainty
Many design choices are provisional. Constructive skepticism is encouraged.

Simulation-first mindset
Changes should be reasoned, testable, and ideally supported by simulation or analysis.

Clarity over cleverness
Readable, well-commented code and clear explanations are preferred over optimization or abstraction.

Respectful discourse
Disagreement is expected; dismissiveness is not.

Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

Asking technical or conceptual questions in Discussions

Proposing design alternatives or pointing out limitations

Improving documentation or diagrams

Fixing bugs or improving simulation fidelity

Adding validation, tests, or logging

Suggesting better modeling assumptions (aero, thermal, control, etc.)

Small, focused contributions are perfectly acceptable.

Getting Started

Read the README to understand the project scope and current architecture.

Browse Discussions for ongoing or unresolved topics.

Check existing Issues before opening a new one.

If unsure where something belongs, start a Discussion first.

Code Contributions

If you plan to contribute code:

Fork the repository and create a feature branch.

Keep changes scoped to a single concern where possible.

Follow existing project structure and naming conventions.

Comment assumptions, units, and reference frames explicitly.

Avoid introducing dependencies unless clearly justified.

Simulation & Control Code

For control, guidance, or dynamics-related contributions:

State assumptions clearly (frames, sign conventions, simplifications).

Avoid hard-coded constants without explanation.

Prefer physically meaningful parameters over tuned “magic numbers”.

If modifying controllers, explain stability or robustness implications.

Documentation Contributions

Documentation is as valuable as code.

You’re encouraged to:

Clarify ambiguous sections

Add diagrams or explanatory comments

Improve README sections or Markdown files

Correct inaccuracies or outdated assumptions

If something is unclear to you, it’s likely unclear to others.

Issues & Discussions

Use Issues for bugs, concrete tasks, or actionable improvements.

Use Discussions for questions, design debates, and exploratory ideas.

When opening either, provide context and reasoning—not just conclusions.

What This Project Is (and Isn’t)

This is not a production system.

This is not a finished or optimized design.

This is an evolving research platform.

This is a place for careful thinking, experimentation, and learning.

Contributions that acknowledge uncertainty and trade-offs are especially appreciated.

Code of Conduct

Be respectful, patient, and professional.
Harassment, condescension, or bad-faith engagement will not be tolerated.

Final Note

You don’t need permission to ask a question or share an idea.
If you’re thinking carefully and acting in good faith, your contribution is welcome.

Thank you for helping improve MARID.
