Modular Aerospace Robotics & Integrated Design (MARID) is a research UAV framework developed in ROS 2 and Gazebo. This repository showcases simulation, modeling, and control of advanced UAV concepts using modular aerodynamic surfaces, configurable propulsion, and robotics integration.


ROS 2 + Gazebo Simulation: Fully integrated environment for testing UAV dynamics and control.

URDF/Xacro Models: Parametric description of UAV geometry and joints.

Custom Controllers: ROS 2 nodes in Python/C++ for wing/actuator commands and thrust management.

Gazebo Worlds & Plugins: Wind, wrench, IMU, and thruster integration for realistic testing.

Trajectory & State Estimation: Odometry, IMU, and Kalman filter examples for UAV navigation.
